# Weather_Point
A web application which shows the weather conditions of a location in a snap and developed using Open Weather API.
Our website asks the permission of the user before accessing their location.
After the user grants permission , the location is accessed , and the weather conditions are displayed.
However , if the user doesn't want their location to be accessed , they can deny and give the location manually.
Our website displays accurate results for both the cases.
